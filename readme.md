====================================================================================

Live demo: [FGx Plane Spotter]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-plane-spotter/index.html "Happy spotting!")

For the generic 3D map used as the basis here see also: [ Jaanga UnFlatland]( https://github.com/jaanga/cookbook/tree/gh-pages/un-flatland )

For [Leap Motion]( https://www.leapmotion.com/ ) device enabled and earlier versions see: [Flying Leap 3D]( https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects/flying-leap-3d )

## Concept
View live [FGx Crossfeed]( http://crossfeed.fgx.ch/data ) data - showing current FlightGear sessions - in the context of an interactive 3D map.

## Features
* Shows FGx Crossfeed aircraft in 3D
* First person controller displays selected aircraft in front of camera
* Places dropdown lists the airports. 
* See also: [Jaanga unFlatland Read Me]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/un-flatland/index.html#features ).

## Road Map

### Overview
The current app shows an amusing, hopefully, toy-like view of the FGx Crossfeed data.
There is, however, nothing stopping FGx Plane Spotter from becoming an extreme;y serious and useful on-line mapping and tracking app 
- useful for FGx Crossfeed data and for any application that wants to display movements of a global nature.

The wish list of possibilities has been started - and many more items can be added

But, before that work proceeds in earnest on the specific item wish list, there are three significant repositories that need to be updated or created and in operation.

Each of the three is an amusing, challenging job in its own right. No task is particularly difficult. 
The challenge is finding cool ways of automating the processes and procedures.


### 1. FGx Terrain
The proposed work is described in detail here: [Jaanga unFlatland Read Me]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/un-flatland/index.html#terrain ).

The FGx crew should decide whether or not FGx wishes to take on the terrain elevation bitmap project and create and maintain the repository and its data.

### 2. FGx Aircraft
The proposed work is described in detail here: [FGx Aircraft]( https://github.com/fgx/fgx-aircraft/index.html#roadMap )

The FGx crew should decide whether or not FGx wishes to take on the aircraft repository (and browser/viewers) projects and create and maintain the repositories and their data.

### 3. FGx Airports
The current location used by FGx Plane Spotter to access ICAO airport, runway and navaid data is via linking to a sub-directory in a repository belonging to Geoff here:

<https://github.com/geoffmcl/map-test2/tree/gh-pages/data>

The FGx crew should decide whether or not to bring in Geoff's and maintain it as a standalone repository that can be used by a variety of apps built by FGx or by others.


### Repository Tiles
The titles of the above-mentioned three repositories are suggestions only.
But the idea should so that a first time visitor to the FGx site has a fairly clear picture of what they are likely to find in a repository._

### Specific Item Wish List
See also Road Map for the generic underlying mapping app: [unFlatLand]( https://github.com/jaanga/cookbook/tree/gh-pages/un-flatland/index.html#tib )

* Access to full list of 27K+ ICAO locations
* ICAO Airports display runways and ILS geometry
* Mouseover ICAO location displays heads-up window with further details
* Mouseover aircraft displays window with further details - see FGx Globe
* Cameras can be located at ATC position of current airport
* Cameras can be associated with any aircraft
* Display stars or clouds
* Display real-time weather
* Display 'smoke trails' showing aircraft path
* Display aircraft instrument panels

## Issues /Bugs

* Jerky 'myplane' with incorrect heading
