For generic 3D map see also: [ Jaanga UnFlatland]( https://github.com/jaanga/cookbook/tree/gh-pages/un-flatland )

For [Leap Motion]( https://www.leapmotion.com/ ) device enabled and earlier versions see: [Flying Leap 3D]( https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects/flying-leap-3d )

## Concept
View live [FGx Crossfeed]( http://crossfeed.fgx.ch/data ) data - showing current FlightGear sessions - in the context of an interactive 3D map.

## Features
* Shows Crossfeed aircraft in 3D
* First person controller displays selected aircraft in front of camera
* Places dropdown lists the airports. 

## Road Map
The current app shows an amusing, hopefully, toy-like view of the FGx Crossfeed data.
There is, however, nothing stopping FGx Plane Spooter from becoming an extreme;y serius and useful online mapping and tracking app 
- useful for FGx Crossfeed data and for any application that wants to display movements of a global nature.

The wish list of possibilities has been started - and many more items will be aded

There three significant hurdles to be overcome before any significant work is carried out on the wish list.

1. Develop the database of online 3D terrain eleveation bitmaps. This work is decribed  

### Overview
The current 
### Specific Item Wish List
See also Road Map for the generic underlying mapping app: [unFlatLand]( https://github.com/jaanga/cookbook/tree/gh-pages/un-flatland/index.html#tib )
